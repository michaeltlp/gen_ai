    Date: The date of the recorded data (e.g., "01-01-2021").
    Control Point: The location where the data was recorded (e.g., "Airport", "Express Rail Link West Kowloon", "Hung Hom").
    Arrival / Departure: Indicates whether the data corresponds to arrivals or departures.
    Hong Kong Residents: The number of Hong Kong residents recorded.
    Mainland Visitors: The number of visitors from mainland China.
    Other Visitors: The number of visitors from regions other than Hong Kong and mainland China.
    Total: The total number of passengers recorded, which is the sum of the previous three columns.
    Unnamed: 7: This column is empty and likely does not contain relevant data.

The dataset provides insights into passenger traffic patterns at different control points, distinguishing between local residents, mainland visitors, and other international visitors. This data can be useful for analyzing travel trends, the impact of travel restrictions, and transportation planning.
