2. The result of the execution is:
```
The data provided in the new file is consistent with the previous file. It includes daily passenger traffic statistics at various control points in Hong Kong, categorized by arrivals and departures. Here's an explanation of the columns:

    Date: The date of the recorded data (e.g., "01-01-2021").
    Control Point: The location where the data was recorded (e.g., "Airport", "Express Rail Link West Kowloon", "Hung Hom").
    Arrival / Departure: Indicates whether the data corresponds to arrivals or departures.
    Hong Kong Residents: The number of Hong Kong residents recorded.
    Mainland Visitors: The number of visitors from mainland China.
    Other Visitors: The number of visitors from regions other than Hong Kong and mainland China.
    Total: The total number of passengers recorded, which is the sum of the previous three columns.
    Unnamed: 7: This column is empty and likely does not contain relevant data.

The dataset provides insights into passenger traffic patterns at different control points, distinguishing between local residents, mainland visitors, and other international visitors. This data can be useful for analyzing travel trends, the impact of travel restrictions, and transportation planning.

Key statistics:

    Mean: Provides the average number of passengers in each category.
    Standard Deviation (std): Indicates the variability in the number of passengers.
    Minimum (min): Shows the lowest recorded number of passengers.
    Maximum (max): Shows the highest recorded number of passengers.
    Count: The total number of days data was recorded.

2. Generate suitable charts


```
We can generate several suitable charts from this data, such as:

    Total Passenger Traffic Over Time: Showing the total number of passengers (both arrivals and departures) over time.
    Daily Arrivals and Departures: Separate line charts for daily arrivals and departures.
    Passenger Traffic by Control Point: Comparing the total traffic through different control points.
    Passenger Composition: Breakdown of passengers into Hong Kong residents, mainland visitors, and other visitors over time.

Let's start by generating these charts.
##Chart 1: Total Passenger Traffic Over Time

We'll first convert the date column to a datetime format and aggregate the total passenger traffic over time.
Chart 2: Daily Arrivals and Departures

We'll create separate line charts for daily arrivals and departures.
Chart 3: Passenger Traffic by Control Point

We'll compare the total traffic through different control points.
Chart 4: Passenger Composition

We'll show the breakdown of passengers into Hong Kong residents, mainland visitors, and other visitors over time. ​
