# Chain of Thought (CoT) Framework

Chain of Thought (CoT) is a framework for creating prompts that enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by instructing the AI to solve problems step by step. This approach is especially useful for solving complex problems or analytical tasks.

## Description

**1. Basic Concept:**
   - **Definition:** Chain of Thought is an approach that helps AI models solve problems by systematically going through each step.
   - **Function:** By directing the AI to think step by step, the thought process becomes more organized and comprehensive, resulting in more accurate and structured answers.

**2. Use Cases:**
   - **Problem Solving:** Suitable for math questions, logic puzzles, or complex problems that require detailed analysis.
   - **Analytical Tasks:** Useful for risk assessment, decision-making, or any situation that requires critical thinking and in-depth analysis.

**3. Implementation:**
   - **Simple Step:** Add the phrase _Let's think step-by-step_ at the end of your prompt.
   - **Example:** If you are faced with a complex math problem, you can give instructions like: "Can you solve this problem? Let's think step-by-step."

## Usage Examples

| **No.** | **Example**                          | **Prompt** |
|---------:|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.       | **Math Problem**            | "Can you solve this quadratic equation: \( x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 6 = 0 \)? Let's think step-by-step." |
| 2.       | **Risk Analysis**              | "What are the main risks in this investment? Let's think step-by-step." |
| 3.       | **Solving Logic Puzzles** | "A murderer is sentenced to death. He has to choose between three rooms. The first is full of raging fire, the second is full of assassins with guns, and the third is full of lions that haven't eaten for 3 years. Which room is the safest for him? Let's think step-by-step." |
| 4.       | **Business Decision Making** | "How can I increase the company's sales? Let's think step-by-step." |
| 5.       | **Project Planning**           | "How can I effectively plan this project? Let's think step-by-step." |

### Conclusion

Using the CoT framework helps ensure that every aspect of a problem or task is analyzed thoroughly and systematically. By adding the phrase "Let's think step-by-step" to your prompt, you guide the AI to think more logically and systematically, which can improve the accuracy and quality of the responses provided.
