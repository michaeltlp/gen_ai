# RTF Framework: _Role_, _Task_, and _Format_

The RTF framework is an approach for structuring and categorizing requests or instructions in a clearer and more organized way. "RTF" stands for _Role_, _Task_, and _Format_.

## Description
Here is a detailed explanation of each element in this framework:

1. **_Role_:**
   - **Definition:** The role refers to who will perform the given task. This can refer to oneself, another person, or even a specific tool or system.
   - **Example:** A student, an employee, a manager, or an AI system like ChatGPT.

2. **_Task_:**
   - **Definition:** The task is what needs to be done. This includes specific actions or activities expected from the individual or system in the stated role.
   - **Example:** Writing a report, sending an email, preparing a plan, or searching for information.

3. **_Format_:**
   - **Definition:** The format refers to how the task's outcome should be delivered. This can include the form, style, or structure of the expected output.
   - **Example:** Essay, presentation slides, table, or summary.
     
## Usage Examples

Using the RTF framework, requests become clearer and easier to understand, ensuring more effective communication and accurate output. Here are five usage examples of the RTF framework in various situations:

|No.| **Topic** | **Role** | **Task** | **Format** | **Prompt** |
|---|------------|----------|----------|------------|------------|
|1.| **Writing a Formal Email** | Me (as an employee) | Write an email to request leave | Formal email | "As an employee, I need to write a formal email to request leave from my manager. Can you help me draft that email?" |
|2.| **Preparing a Report** | Me (as a student) | Prepare a research report | Formal report with sections for introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion | "As a student, I need to prepare a research report on climate change. Can you help me draft a complete report with sections for introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion?" |
|3.| **Searching for Information** | You (ChatGPT) | Search for best practices in time management | List of recommendations | "As ChatGPT, can you search for best practices in time management and provide me with a list of recommendations?" |
|4.| **Creating a Recipe** | Chef | Create a recipe using specific ingredients | Step-by-step recipe | "As a chef, I want you to create a recipe using ingredients like chicken, garlic, and vegetables. Can you provide me with a step-by-step recipe?" |
|5.| **Creating a Workout Plan** | Me (as an individual wanting to exercise) | Create a daily workout plan | Weekly exercise schedule | "As an individual starting a fitness routine, I need to create a daily workout plan. Can you help me draft a weekly exercise schedule that is easy to follow?" |

This table clearly shows how each element in the RTF framework is used to structure requests or instructions in a more systematic and understandable way.
