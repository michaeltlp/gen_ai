# RISE Framework: _Role, Input, Steps, Expectation_

The RISE framework is a structured method that emphasizes defining roles, providing inputs, outlining steps, and setting expectations to guide generative AI in producing text that meets users' needs and objectives. By structuring prompts according to these elements, users can ensure clarity and effectiveness in communication.

## Description

1. **_Role_**
   - **Description**: The role component defines the persona or perspective from which ChatGPT should approach the prompt. It identifies the character, identity, or role the AI needs to assume in its response.
   - **Example**: "As a human resources manager"

2. **_Input_**
   - **Description**: The input component involves providing relevant information, data, or instructions to guide ChatGPT in generating the text. It outlines specific inputs, directives, or cues that the AI needs to consider while composing the response.
   - **Example**: "Provide information on employee job satisfaction levels over the past six months."

3. **_Steps_**
   - **Description**: The steps component outlines the sequence of actions, tasks, or procedures that ChatGPT should follow in responding to the prompt. It provides a structured framework to guide the AI's text generation, ensuring coherence and relevance in the output.
   - **Example**: "1) Analyze job satisfaction data, 2) Identify key trends or issues, 3) Suggest solutions to improve job satisfaction."

4. **_Expectation_**
   - **Description**: The expectation component clarifies the outcome, goals, or objectives the user wants to achieve through the interaction with generative AI. It specifies the user's expectations and guides the AI in generating text that aligns with those objectives.
   - **Example**: "We hope to see at least a 10% improvement in job satisfaction within three months."

## How to Use

1. **Start with _Role_**
   - Define the role or persona the AI needs to assume in its response.
   - Example: "As a digital marketing expert"

2. **Specify the Required _Input_**
   - Provide specific information, data, or instructions the AI needs to consider.
   - Example: "Please analyze the website traffic data for the past three months."

3. **Outline the _Steps_ to Follow**
   - Define the sequence of actions or procedures the AI should follow.
   - Example: "1) Identify the main sources of traffic, 2) Analyze user behavior patterns, 3) Suggest strategies to increase traffic."

4. **Set Clear _Expectation_**
   - Clarify the desired outcome or goals to be achieved through the interaction with the AI.
   - Example: "We aim to see a 20% increase in website traffic within two months."
