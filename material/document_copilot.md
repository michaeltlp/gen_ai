Once the document is open in Microsoft Edge, you can use the toolbar at the top of the screen to navigate the document, adjust the view size, and search for specific text. Microsoft Edge also provides functions to edit, save, or print the PDF document.

## 3. Available Functions for Document Analysis

Document analysis of PDFs in Microsoft Edge can be performed using the available functions such as:

1. **Opening PDFs**: You can easily open PDF documents in Microsoft Edge by simply double-clicking the file or dragging and dropping the file into the Edge browser window.

2. **Editing PDFs**: Microsoft Edge allows you to fill in blank fields on the PDF or add new text. You can select 'Edit' from the toolbar to start editing and save the edited PDF by selecting 'Save.'

3. **Adding Notes**: You can also add new text, images, and shapes to the PDF by selecting 'Add notes' on the top toolbar. This is suitable for highlighting important information or making annotations on the document.

4. **Printing PDFs**: To print a PDF document from Microsoft Edge, open the PDF and select 'Print' from the toolbar. Then choose your printer and desired print options, and select 'Print' to start printing.

5. **Saving PDFs**: After making edits and printing a hard copy, you may want to save your PDF. Open the PDF in Edge, select 'Save,' specify the save location, name the file, and save it.

6. **Translating PDFs**: Microsoft Edge allows you to translate text from PDF documents into other languages. Select the text you want to translate, then click the translate icon in the PDF toolbar.
