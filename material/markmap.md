# Markmap
Markmap is a tool that visualizes markdown documents as interactive mind maps. It's useful for organizing and navigating complex information, making it easier to understand and explore the content. Here's how you can use Markmap:

## 1. Prompt to create a mind map
Please type this prompt in tools like Copilot, Gemini, and ChatGPT.

  ```
a mind map with a structured list that is centred on [Your Topic]. Create a Markdown version of the mind map.
Start with the primary concept that embodies the primary theme found in the data. Create primary branches based on
the identified categories or important subjects. Create thorough sub-branches that focus on certain data points,
patterns, or insights for every major branch. Make sure the linkages and hierarchies within the data are adequately
visualised in the mind map.
  ```

### Example: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics

# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethics
## Primary Concept
- **Ethical Principles**

  - Balancing security and privacy
  - Regulation of AI surveillance technologies

This mind map provides a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of the primary theme and its related categories, ensuring that the linkages and hierarchies within the data are clearly illustrated.  ```

```
## 2. [MarkMap](https://markmap.js.org/repl)
Paste the Markdown code into [MarkMap](https://markmap.js.org/repl): Open Markmap and paste your copied markdown content. Markmap will automatically generate an interactive mind map based on the markdown structure.

**Example**: Amanat Naib Canselor

</p>

## 3. Interact with Your Mind Map
You can expand or collapse branches, zoom in and out, and pan around to explore different parts of the mind map.

Remember, Markmap supports various markdown features such as:
- **Styling**: Apply bold, italic, strikethrough, and highlights to text.
- **Code Blocks**: Include code snippets or formulas.
- **Images and Links**: Embed images and create hyperlinks.

Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/michaeltlp/gen_ai/issues) for any improvements, suggestions, or to report errors in the content.
